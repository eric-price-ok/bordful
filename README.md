## Getting Started

### 5-Minute Quick Start

Get your Bordful job board up and running in just 5 minutes with this step-by-step guide:

#### Prerequisites (2 minutes)

**1. Install an AI Code Editor (Highly Recommended)**
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** - AI-powered code editor with built-in chat
- **[Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/refer?referral_code=d886df4b0e)** - Agentic AI coding assistant
- **Why?** These editors will help you customize your job board with AI assistance, even if you're not a developer!

**2. Install Node.js (Required)**

**Easy Method - Download Installer:**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS version (recommended for most users)
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts

![Download Node.js](public/download-nodejs.jpg)

**Advanced Method - Command Line:**
```bash
# On macOS (if you have Homebrew)
brew install node

# On Windows (if you have Chocolatey)
choco install nodejs
```

**3. Verify Installation**
Open your Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

![Check Node and NPM Versions](public/check-node-and-npm-versions.jpg)

```bash
node --version  # Should show v18+ or higher
npm --version   # Should show 8+ or higher
```

✅ **Success Check:** If you see version numbers, you're ready to continue!

#### Step 1: Get the Code (1 minute)

**Option A: Using GitHub's Web Interface (No Command Line Required)**
1. Go to [GitHub Import](https://github.com/new/import)
2. Enter repository URL: `https://github.com/craftled/bordful`
3. Choose your username and repository name (e.g., `my-job-board`)
4. Set visibility to "Private" (recommended)
5. Click "Begin import"
6. Once complete, click "Clone or download" → "Download ZIP"
7. Extract the ZIP file to your desired folder
8. Open Terminal/Command Prompt in that folder and run: `npm install`

✅ **Benefits**: Private by default, no Git knowledge required, ready for Vercel deployment

**Option B: Using Command Line (For Developers)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/craftled/bordful
cd bordful

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Option A is perfect if you're not comfortable with Git or want to keep your code private from the start.

#### Step 2: Set Up Airtable Database (2 minutes)

**What is Airtable?** It's like a smart spreadsheet that will store your job listings. Think of it as your job board's database, but easier to use than Excel.

**Option A: Use Our Template (Recommended)**
1. Click this link: [Bordful Airtable Template](https://airtable.com/apprhCjWTxfG3JX5p/shrLqfxgbensCY393)
2. Click "Use this data" to add it to your Airtable workspace
3. **Find your Base ID:** Look at the URL in your browser - it will look like `https://airtable.com/appABC123DEFGHIJK/...`
4. Copy the part that starts with `app` (e.g., `appABC123DEFGHIJK`) - this is your Base ID

![Copy Airtable Base ID](public/copy-airtable-base-id.jpg)

✅ **Success Check:** You should see a table with sample job listings and fields like "Title", "Company", "Status", etc.

**Option B: Create Your Own**
- See our [Airtable Setup Guide](/docs/getting-started/airtable-setup.md) for detailed instructions

#### Step 3: Get Your Airtable API Token (1 minute)

1. Go to [Airtable Tokens](https://airtable.com/create/tokens)
2. Click "Create new token"
3. Give it a name like "Bordful Job Board"
4. Add these scopes: `data.records:read`, `data.records:write`
5. Add your base from Step 2
6. Click "Create token" and copy the token (starts with `pat...`)

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables (1 minute)

**What are environment variables?** They're like secret settings that tell your job board how to connect to Airtable. Think of them as your app's private configuration.

**Step 4a: Copy the template file**
```bash
# Copy the example file to create your environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

**Step 4b: Edit your settings**
You need to edit the `.env` file with your actual values. Here's how:

**On Mac:** Open the file with TextEdit or your AI editor (Cursor/Windsurf)
**On Windows:** Open the file with Notepad or your AI editor (Cursor/Windsurf)

Replace the placeholder values with your real information:

```env
# REQUIRED: Your application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# REQUIRED: Airtable credentials (from steps 2 & 3)
AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=pat_your_actual_token_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app_your_actual_base_id_here
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Jobs

# OPTIONAL: Email provider for job alerts (you can add this later)
EMAIL_PROVIDER=encharge
ENCHARGE_WRITE_KEY=your_encharge_key_here
```

✅ **Success Check:** Your `.env` file should have real values (starting with `pat_` and `app_`) instead of placeholder text.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never share your `.env` file or commit it to Git! It contains your secret keys.

#### Step 5: Start Your Job Board (30 seconds)

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

🎉 **That's it!** Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your job board in action.

**What you should see:**
- A homepage with job listings (from your Airtable template)
- Search and filter functionality
- Clean, professional design

![Bordful Job Board Running](public/bordful-localhost.jpg)

✅ **Success Check:** If you see job listings on your homepage, congratulations! Your job board is working.

❌ **Not working?** Jump to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

### What You Get Out of the Box

- ✅ Fully functional job board with search and filtering
- ✅ Responsive design that works on all devices
- ✅ SEO-optimized with automatic sitemaps
- ✅ RSS feeds for job listings
- ✅ Admin-friendly Airtable interface for managing jobs
- ✅ AI-assisted customization with Cursor/Windsurf editors

### Next Steps

1. **Add Your First Job**: 
   - Go to your Airtable base
   - Click the "+" button to add a new row
   - Fill in: Title, Company, Description, Status (set to "Published")
   - Refresh your job board to see it appear!

![Airtable Add New Job](public/airtable-add-new-job.jpg)

2. **Customize Your Brand**: 
   - Copy `config/config.example.ts` to `config/config.ts` and customize
   - 💡 **Pro Tip**: Open the project in Cursor/Windsurf and ask the AI: "Help me customize the colors and branding for my job board"
3. **Set Up Job Alerts**: Add email provider credentials to enable job alert subscriptions
4. **Deploy to Production**: See our [Deployment Guide](#deployment-to-vercel) below

### Deployment to Vercel (Production)

Ready to go live? Deploy to Vercel in 3 steps:

#### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

```bash
# Test your build locally first
npm run build
npm run start
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

**If you used Option A (GitHub Import) in Step 1:**
1. Your code is already on GitHub - skip to step 2!

**If you used Option B (Command Line) in Step 1:**
1. Push your code to GitHub (without the `.env` file, `.gitignore` file already ignores it)

**For everyone:**
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" and import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect it's a Next.js project

#### Step 3: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
2. Add these variables one by one:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://your-domain.vercel.app
AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN = pat_your_token_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = app_your_base_id_here
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME = Jobs
```

3. Click "Deploy" and your job board will be live!

### Troubleshooting

**Jobs not showing up?**
- Check your Airtable base has jobs with `status` field set to "Published"
- Verify your `AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` are correct in `.env`

**`npm install` not working?**
- Make sure Node.js is installed: run `node --version`
- Navigate to the correct folder before running the command
- On Windows, try running Command Prompt as Administrator

**Can't open Terminal/Command Prompt?**
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Windows:** Press `Windows key`, type "Command Prompt", press Enter

**Need help?** Check our [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation.md) for detailed instructions.

### AI-Powered Customization

With Cursor or Windsurf AI editors, you can easily customize your job board. Try these prompts:

**🎨 Change Colors:**
```
"Help me change the primary color scheme to match my company brand. 
My brand colors are [your colors]. Show me which files to edit."
```

**📝 Update Content:**
```
"I want to change the homepage hero text and add my company name. 
Can you help me find and update the relevant text?"
```

**🚀 Fix Deployment Issues:**
```
"I'm getting this error when deploying to Vercel: [paste error]. 
Can you help me fix it?"
```

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Always describe what you want to achieve rather than asking for specific code!
