# Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

This guide addresses the most common issues you might encounter when installing and setting up your Bordful job board, along with their solutions.

## Environment Setup Issues

### Missing Environment Variables

**Issue:** Your application fails to connect to Airtable or shows errors related to environment variables.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you've created a `.env` file in your project root
2. Verify it contains all required variables:
   ```
   AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id_here
   AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=your_table_name_here
   ```
3. Check for typos in your variable names and values
4. Restart your development server after making changes to environment variables

### Wrong Airtable Credentials

**Issue:** Error messages like "Authentication failed" or "Base not found" when trying to fetch data.

**Solution:**
1. Verify your Personal Access Token has these scopes:
   - `data.records:read`
   - `schema.bases:read`
2. Confirm your base is added to the token's access list
3. Double-check your Base ID by going to [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/y2hcMqpl), opening your base, and checking the URL (it will contain `airtable.com/[YOUR_BASE_ID]`)
4. Ensure your token is still valid and has not expired

## Node.js and NPM Issues

### Incompatible Node.js Version

**Issue:** Installation fails with errors related to Node.js compatibility.

**Solution:**
1. Bordful requires Node.js v18 or later
2. Check your Node.js version with:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
3. If your version is below v18, install the latest LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
4. For managing multiple Node.js versions, consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Unix/macOS) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (Windows)

### NPM Dependency Errors

**Issue:** `npm install` fails with dependency conflicts or missing packages.

**Solution:**
1. Try clearing the npm cache:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```
2. Delete the node_modules folder and package-lock.json:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```
3. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. If issues persist, check for global npm configuration problems:
   ```bash
   npm config list
   ```

## Configuration Issues

### Missing Configuration File

**Issue:** Error indicating the config file is missing or improperly formatted.

**Solution:**
1. Create the config file by copying the example:
   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.ts config/config.ts
   ```
2. Customize the settings as needed
3. Ensure the file has the correct TypeScript format

### TypeScript Errors in Configuration

**Issue:** TypeScript errors when building or running the development server.

**Solution:**
1. Check your config.ts file for type errors
2. Ensure all required fields are present
3. Verify that object properties match the expected types
4. Compare your file with the latest config.example.ts for any structure changes
5. Fix any type errors by adjusting your configuration values

## Next.js Build and Development Issues

### Build Fails

**Issue:** Next.js build fails with various errors.

**Solution:**
1. Check for TypeScript errors in your custom code
2. Verify that all required dependencies are installed
3. Look for path or import errors in custom components
4. For specific error messages, refer to the Next.js documentation or search for the error online
5. Try clearing the Next.js cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```

### Development Server Crashes

**Issue:** The development server crashes or restarts continuously.

**Solution:**
1. Check the console output for specific error messages
2. Look for problems in your custom components or pages
3. Verify that your Airtable setup is correct
4. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
5. Check for memory issues if you have a large dataset

2. Ensure all required fields have the correct types (Single line text, Number, etc.)
3. Add any missing fields to your Airtable base
4. Check field names for exact spelling matches (case-sensitive)

### Empty Job Listings

**Issue:** The job board shows no listings even though you have data in Airtable.

**Solution:**
1. Verify your jobs have "active" status in the status field
2. Check that you're using the correct table name in your environment variables
3. Ensure your Airtable Personal Access Token has read permissions
4. Verify the fields in your Airtable base match those expected by Bordful
5. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools for API errors

## Styling and UI Issues

### Tailwind Styles Not Applied

**Issue:** The application looks unstyled or CSS is not being applied correctly.

**Solution:**

### Debugging Airtable Connectivity

For deeper Airtable connectivity issues:

1. Create a simple test script to verify Airtable API access:
   ```typescript
   // test-airtable.ts
   import { fetchJobs } from './lib/db/airtable';
   
   async function testAirtable() {
     try {
       const jobs = await fetchJobs();
       console.log('Jobs fetched successfully:', jobs.length);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Airtable error:', error);
     }
   }
   
   testAirtable();
   ```
2. Run with:
   ```bash
